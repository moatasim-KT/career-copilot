# Frontend: Complete API Integration and UI Implementation

**Tags:** frontend, api, ui

## Tasks

1. For every frontend feature/page/component:
   - Ensure it is fully integrated with the backend via the unified API client (`frontend/src/lib/api/client.ts`).
   - Implement all UI logic, state management, and error handling for each feature (jobs, applications, recommendations, personalization, analytics, notifications, social, resume, content, feedback, integrations, storage, etc.).
   - All forms, tables, lists, and detail views must be fully functional and connected to real backend data.
   - No mockups, placeholders, or sample data. All data must come from the backend.
   - All UI/UX must be production-grade, responsive, and accessible.
   - All error and loading states must be handled gracefully.
   - All frontend logic must be complete, with no stubs or partial implementations.
2. Remove any code or logic that requires authentication or login for API access or page access.
3. All API calls must be public and require no auth tokens.
4. All frontend code must be ready for local deployment and use.
