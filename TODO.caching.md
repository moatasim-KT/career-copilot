# Caching: Full Implementation and Invalidation

**Tags:** caching, backend, performance

## Tasks

1. Implement Redis caching for all endpoints that require it (jobs, recommendations, analytics, personalization, etc.).
2. Ensure all cache keys, TTLs, and invalidation logic are robust and production-ready.
3. Remove any stub or sample cache logic. All caching must be real and effective.
4. Document all cache strategies and keys.
