# Reports Directory

This directory contains all generated reports from various tools and test runs. Reports are organized by category for easy navigation.

## Report Types

### Performance Reports
- **Performance Optimization Reports**: Generated by performance testing scripts
- **Database Performance Reports**: Query performance analysis and optimization suggestions
- **Load Test Results**: Performance under load conditions

### Security Reports
- **Bandit**: Python code security analysis
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis for security patterns
- **NPM Audit**: Frontend dependency security check
- **Pip Audit**: Backend dependency security check

### Test Reports
- **Unit Test Results**: pytest execution results
- **Integration Test Results**: Service integration test outcomes
- **E2E Test Results**: End-to-end test execution data

## Generating Reports

### Performance Reports
```bash
# Backend performance
python scripts/performance/performance_test.py

# Database analysis
python scripts/performance/database_performance.py
```

### Security Reports
```bash
# Run all security scans
make security

# Individual scans
bandit -r backend/app -f json -o reports/security/bandit_report.json
safety check --json > reports/security/safety-report.json
```

### Test Reports
```bash
# Generate test reports with coverage
pytest --junitxml=reports/test-reports/pytest-results.xml --cov-report=json
```

## Cleanup

Reports are gitignored by default to keep the repository clean. To clean old reports:

```bash
# Remove all reports older than 7 days
find reports/ -name "*.json" -mtime +7 -delete
find reports/ -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete

# Remove all reports (fresh start)
rm -rf reports/performance/* reports/database/* reports/security/*
```

## Note

- Reports should **never** contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Large reports (>10MB) should be excluded from version control
- Keep reports organized by timestamp: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` format
