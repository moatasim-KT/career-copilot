Use the existing conda environment inside the codebase to activate before doing tasks
Use git commit after every major change to checkpoint it all the way through
DOnt create shortcuts or simplified scripts
Dont create tests that dont test the required features completely if an import is missing. It should be added to the requirements and installed so the script can be tested completely without bypassing any import requirements
