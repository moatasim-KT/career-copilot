# Project Roadmap & Development Gaps

This section documents the identified gaps, unimplemented features, and placeholders within the Career Copilot project. This information is synthesized from code comments, [[../TODO.md]], and other project documentation.

## Overview

The roadmap represents a comprehensive view of planned features, known gaps, and areas requiring implementation. It serves as a guide for future development and ensures systematic addressing of all identified issues.

## Major Categories

### [[backend-gaps.md|Backend Implementation Gaps]]
High-level features and functionalities planned but not yet fully implemented in the backend.

### [[frontend-gaps.md|Frontend Implementation Gaps]]
Frontend-specific gaps, API integrations, and UI component placeholders.

### [[code-todos.md|Code-Level TODOs & Placeholders]]
Granular implementation items found directly in the codebase.

### [[documentation-todos.md|Documentation TODOs]]
Areas where documentation needs updating or creation.

### [[prioritization.md|Prioritization & Timeline]]
