    }
  },
  "routing": {
    "default_strategy": "adaptive",
    "fallback_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Security Best Practices

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:
1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Rotate secrets regularly** (JWT keys, API keys)
3. **Use strong passwords** (min 32 characters for JWT secret)
4. **Enable HTTPS** in production
5. **Restrict CORS origins** to trusted domains only
6. **Use environment variables** for secrets in production (not `.env` files)

## 👨‍💻 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python (Backend)

- **Formatter**: Ruff (replaces Black + isort)
- **Linter**: Ruff (replaces Flake8)
- **Type Checker**: MyPy
- **Docstrings**: Google-style

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class JobCreate(BaseModel):
    """Schema for creating a new job posting.
    
    Attributes:
        company: Name of the hiring company
        title: Job title/position
        location: Geographic location or "Remote"
    """
    company: str
    title: str
    location: Optional[str] = None
```

#### TypeScript (Frontend)

- **Formatter**: Prettier
- **Linter**: ESLint with TypeScript plugin
- **Style**: Functional components, hooks

```typescript
interface Job {
  id: number;
  company: string;
  title: string;
  location?: string;
}

export const JobCard: React.FC<{ job: Job }> = ({ job }) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{job.title}</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">{job.company}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/job-recommendations

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add AI-powered job recommendations"

# Commit message format: <type>: <description>
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Automatically run on every commit:
- Code formatting (Ruff, Prettier)
- Linting (Ruff, ESLint)
- Type checking (MyPy, TypeScript)
- Security checks (Bandit)

```bash
# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Required for all new services and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Required for API endpoints
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% code coverage

```python
# Example test
def test_create_job(client, auth_headers, db):
    """Test creating a new job posting."""
    payload = {
        "company": "Test Corp",
        "title": "Developer",
        "location": "Remote"
    }
    response = client.post("/api/v1/jobs", json=payload, headers=auth_headers)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["company"] == "Test Corp"
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create new migration
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add interview feedback column"

# Review generated migration in backend/alembic/versions/

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one version
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Run quality checks: `make quality-check`
4. Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
5. Push and create PR with description
6. Request code review
7. Address review comments
8. Merge after approval

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Database Connection Error

**Problem**: `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: unable to open database file`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Create data directory
mkdir -p data

# Check DATABASE_URL in .env
# Should be: sqlite:///./data/career_copilot.db
```

---

#### 2. ModuleNotFoundError

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/career-copilot

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

---

#### 3. JWT Token Errors

**Problem**: `401 Unauthorized: Invalid or expired token`

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure JWT_SECRET_KEY is set in .env
# 2. Generate a new secret if needed
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# 3. Restart backend server
# 4. Login again to get fresh token
```

---

#### 4. OpenAI API Errors

**Problem**: `openai.error.AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key`

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Verify API key in .env
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  # Should start with sk-

# 2. Test API key
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# 3. Generate new key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

---

#### 5. Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

**Problem**: `Network Error` or `CORS policy` errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Verify backend is running
curl http://localhost:8002/api/v1/health

# 2. Check CORS_ORIGINS in .env includes frontend URL
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8501

# 3. Restart backend after changes
```

---

#### 6. Redis Connection Error

**Problem**: `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG

# Start Redis
# macOS: brew services start redis
# Ubuntu: sudo systemctl start redis

# Or disable Redis in .env
REDIS_ENABLED=false
```

---

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed error logging:

```bash
# In .env
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# View logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: `logs/app.log` for backend, browser console for frontend
2. **API Documentation**: Visit http://localhost:8002/docs for interactive API testing
3. **GitHub Issues**: Search existing issues or create a new one
4. **Documentation**: Check `docs/` folder for detailed guides

#### Option 1: Render.com (Recommended for Easy Deploy)

The project includes a `render.yaml` configuration:

```bash
# 1. Create Render account at https://render.com
# 2. Connect your GitHub repository
# 3. Render will auto-detect render.yaml
# 4. Add environment variables in Render dashboard
# 5. Deploy!
```

#### Option 2: Docker Compose

```bash
# Build images
docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml build

# Start services
docker-compose -f deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

#### Option 3: Kubernetes

```bash
# Apply manifests
kubectl apply -f deployment/k8s/

# Check deployment
kubectl get pods -n career-copilot
```

#### Option 4: Traditional Server

```bash
# On server (Ubuntu example)
# 1. Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3-pip postgresql nginx redis-server

# 2. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/career-copilot.git
cd career-copilot

# 3. Set up Python environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[all]"

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit with production values

# 5. Set up database
sudo -u postgres createdb career_copilot
alembic upgrade head

# 6. Build frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# 7. Set up systemd services
sudo cp deployment/services/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable career-copilot-backend
sudo systemctl start career-copilot-backend

# 8. Configure Nginx
sudo cp deployment/nginx/career-copilot.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/career-copilot.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Backend
# Use Gunicorn with multiple workers
gunicorn backend.app.main:app \
  -w 4 \
  -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:8002

# Frontend
# Enable production optimizations
npm run build  # Creates optimized production build
npm run start  # Serves production build
```

### Monitoring & Observability

**Prometheus Metrics**: http://your-domain.com/metrics

**Health Checks**:
```bash
# Liveness
curl http://your-domain.com/api/v1/health

# Readiness
curl http://your-domain.com/api/v1/health/ready
```

**Log Aggregation**:
- Configured with Loki/Promtail (see `monitoring/loki-config.yaml`)
- Alternatively, integrate with CloudWatch, Datadog, or Elasticsearch

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Automated backups (configured in .env)
BACKUP_ENABLED=true
BACKUP_SCHEDULE=0 2 * * *  # Daily at 2 AM
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Manual backup
cd backend
python -m app.cli backup create --name manual-backup

# Restore from backup
python -m app.cli backup restore --file backups/manual-backup.sql
```

### Security Hardening

1. **Enable HTTPS**: Use Let's Encrypt or cloud provider SSL
2. **Firewall**: Only expose ports 80, 443
3. **Database**: Use connection pooling, prepared statements
4. **Secrets**: Use environment variables or secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
5. **Rate Limiting**: Enable and tune for your traffic
6. **WAF**: Consider Cloudflare or AWS WAF
7. **Updates**: Regularly update dependencies
